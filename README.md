# bakkenpipelinemap

This map actually uses Carto and "HERE" maps for the basemap.
It's not a part of MapStructor, yet.
If you ever want to use MapStructor, it's still good to have the original since it uses other sources and code that could be insightful in the future. Perhaps create a branch as MapStructor.
